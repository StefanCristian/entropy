:man manual:   eit {eitversion}


NAME
----
eit-inject - inject package files into repository


SYNOPSIS
--------
eit inject [-h] [--to <repository>] <path> [<path> ...]


INTRODUCTION
------------
A Source Package Manager (Portage, for example) can produce
tarballs containing package metadata and the actual content.
If that's the case, Entropy Server can scan the file and extract
all the information needed to add the same to its repository.
In the Entropy world, this is called "*package injection*",
meaning that you're actually "injecting" a SPM package into
an Entropy repository.
Injected packages are "special", because they're not mapped
to an installed SPM package on the currently running system
(or chroot). This has the side effect of Entropy not being
automatically able to detect library breakages, for example.
So please limit the amount of *injected* packages in your
repositories as much as you can.

-------

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

AUTHORS
-------
Eit has been accidentally prototyped during a rainy Sunday by Fabio
Erculiani who was looking for innovative ways of handling package
bumps in Argent Entropy repositories.
A few months later, Eit saw the light.
