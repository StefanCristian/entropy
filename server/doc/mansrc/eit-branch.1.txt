NAME
----
eit-branch - manage repository branches


SYNOPSIS
--------
eit branch [-h] [--quick] [--from <branch>] [--no-copy] [<branch>] [<repo>]


INTRODUCTION
------------
Switch to given branch. This will cause the creation of a
separate repository database on disk and remotely, taking the
name of the branch argument passed.
Only one branch should be used at the same time, but nothing
will prevent you from interleaving them.
Generally, this feature is used to switch the repository to a
new branch, copying all the packages over (default behaviour).
To just switch to an empty branch without copying the packages
over just use the *--no-copy* switch.

-------

AUTHORS
-------
Eit has been accidentally prototyped during a rainy Sunday by Fabio

bumps in Argent Entropy repositories.
A few months later, Eit saw the light.
