NAME
----
eit-merge - merge packages on other branches into current


SYNOPSIS
--------
eit merge [-h] [--in <repository>] [--quick] <branch>


INTRODUCTION
------------
When a repository is switched to a new branch, remote packages,
for mirror size optimization reasons, are kept in current folders exposing
the old branch as sub-directory and referenced from there until
they get replaced into the repository. At some point in the future btw,
older branches would be dismissed and packages in repository on the
current branch referencing packages in older branches should be merged
back in. This tool does exactly this.
