NAME
----
eit-cleanup - clean expired packages from a repository


SYNOPSIS
--------
eit cleanup [-h] [--quick] [--pretend] [--days DAYS] [<repo>]


INTRODUCTION
------------
Clean expired packages from remote mirrors. Usually, packages
have a default expiration timeout set to 15 days (entropy.const),
overridable via *ETP_EXPIRATION_DAYS* env variable.
Expiration date starts from when packages are removed from a repository
due to a version bump or simple removal.
During the final part of packages sync, expired ones are automatically
removed from remote mirrors.
This commands makes possible to manually force a cleanup.
