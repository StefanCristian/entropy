This directory should contain distribution-provided configuration files
extending /etc/entropy/repositories.conf content (only for repository
statements).

Files are processed in lexical order. Filenames: ".keep", "README" are
skipped and never considered.
Files starting with "_" are considered belonging to disabled repositories.
Files ending with ".example" are never considered.

Files created by Entropy Client are prefixed with
"entropy_". So, for example, for "argent-untested" you will get:
"entropy_argent-untested".

Files created by Entropy Server are prefixed with
"entropysrv_". So, for example, for "argent-untested" you will get:
"entropysrv_argent-untested".
