# Server side packages.db.conflicting_tagged file, containing tagged/slotted package
# keys that cannot installed at the same time.
# For example, even if nvidia-drivers packages are slotted and tagged by kernel release
# you cannot have more than one installed due to obvious libGL issues

# LINE CONSTRUCTION:
# <package key (only key!)> <conflicting package atom 1> <conflicting package atom 2> ...
# See examples below

# EXAMPLE:
# x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers
# x11-drivers/foo x11-drivers/foo-old x11-drivers/foo-veryold

# PRESET:
x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers
x11-drivers/ati-drivers x11-drivers/ati-drivers
