# For historical and backward compatibility reasons,
# the first line of this file must point to a Entropy
# WebServices compatible web service that is used by clients
# to retrieve extended repository and packages metadata.
# If not webservice is available, the first line must be set to
# '-'.
# The second and further lines can be a set of variable=value
# statements.
#
# The currently supported variable values are:
# - UPDATE_EAPI=<int>
#   indicates the maximum Entropy API value to use for
#   repository updates. This can be used to disable EAPI >= 3,
#   thus Entropy WebServices support, during repository updates.
# - REPO_EAPI=<int>
#   indicates the maximum Entropy API value to use for
#   User Generated Content. This can be used to disable
#   its support while keeping EAPI=3 repository updates. If the
#   value is less than 3, UGC won't be available.
#
# Please note that this file will be migrated to .ini format
# at some point in the future.
#
# The webservice support is optional and is needed
# to erogate user generated content for packages.
