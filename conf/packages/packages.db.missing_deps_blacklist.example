# Server side packages.db.missing_deps_blacklist file (this has to stay
# in server-side repository directory, usually
# /var/lib/entropy/server/<repoid>/database/<arch>/<branch>
#
# Through this file, it's possible to filter out missing dependencies detected
# by Entropy Server automagic runtime dependencies QA tool. In other words,
# this is useful for listing false positives.
#
# Just list, one per line, dependencies returned by the above QA tool you
# want to filter out, in form of <package key>:<slot>.
#
# For example:
# dev-lang/gnat-gcc:4.2
