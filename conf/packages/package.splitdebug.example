# package.splitdebug example file
#
# In this file you can specify dependencies, one per line, for which you
# would like to have the splitdebug feature turned on. This means that
# if at least one valid entry is listed here, the installation of
# /usr/lib/debug files will be enabled only for it.
# Otherwise, if splitdebug is enabled in client.conf and no entries
# are listed here, splitdebug will be considered enabled for any package.

# LINE CONSTRUCTION:
# <dependency to match>
# See examples below
# NOTE: for inline comments, please use "##" instead of "#"

# EXAMPLES:
# >=media-libs/foo-1.2.3
# media-libs/foo
# <media-libs/foo-1.2.3
# media-libs/foo:1
# >=media-libs/foo-1.2.3#2.6.23-sabayon-r1
# media-libs/foo::sabayon-repo
#
# :1 means package with SLOT="1"
# #2.6.23-sabayon-r1 means package with kernel tag = 2.6.23-sabayon-r1
