# Server and Client side packages.db.fallback_mirrors file.
# In this file, repository administrators can list package mirrors that
# Entropy Client will always consider as fallback (so, keeping it at the
# end of the retry list). You can just list the domain name and will be
# matched against any URL (http://, ftp://).
#

# LINE CONSTRUCTION:
# <mirror uri domain name>
# NOTE: for inline comments, please use "##" instead of "#"
