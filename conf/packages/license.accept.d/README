This directory should contain distribution-provided configuration files
extending /etc/entropy/packages/license.accept content.
User should rather edit /etc/entropy/packages/license.accept instead of
creating files inside this directory.

Files are processed in lexical order. Filenames: ".keep", "README" are
skipped and never considered.
Files ending with ".example" are never considered.
