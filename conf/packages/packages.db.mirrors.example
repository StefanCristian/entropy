# Server and Client side packages.db.mirrors file.
# In this file, repository administrators can list package mirrors that
# Entropy Client will use (beside the ones already in repositories.conf).
# This makes possible to control and keep mirrors up-to-date without
# bothering the user.
#

# LINE CONSTRUCTION:
# <mirror uri>
# NOTE: for inline comments, please use "##" instead of "#"

# EXAMPLES:
# http://foo.entropy.something/
# ftp://entropy.somethingelse.com/
