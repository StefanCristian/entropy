# Server side packages.db.mask file, to allow masking packages
#
# In this file you can specify atoms, one per line, that you would mask.
# Masking a package (atom) means that you will deny Entropy to pull in a package even if it's marked as "NOT experimental".

# LINE CONSTRUCTION:
# <atom>
# See examples below
# NOTE: for inline comments, please use "##" instead of "#"

# EXAMPLES:
# >=media-libs/foo-1.2.3
# media-libs/foo
# <media-libs/foo-1.2.3
# media-libs/foo:1
# >=media-libs/foo-1.2.3#2.6.23-sabayon-r1
#
# :1 means package with SLOT="1"
# #2.6.23-sabayon-r1 means package with kernel tag = 2.6.23-sabayon-r1
